🚀 Codespaces features:

- Repeatable cloud environment offering a push-button experience.
- Can be configured and customized.
- Integrates with your repositories on GitHub and [Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/?WT.mc_id=dotnet-82023-juyooo).

As a teacher that means that you can create an environment, in the cloud, for your class that all students can use with zero or next to zero configuration regardless of what operating system they are using.

## 🧑‍🏫 What is GitHub Codespaces and how can I use it in my teaching?

A Codespace is a development environment that's hosted in the cloud that you can configure. The Codespaces Education benefit gives Global Campus teachers a free monthly allowance of GitHub Codespaces hours to use in [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). Learn more [here](https://docs.github.com/education/manage-coursework-with-github-classroom/integrate-github-classroom-with-an-ide/using-github-codespaces-with-github-classroom) about Using GitHub Codespaces with GitHub Classroom.

If you are not already a Global Campus teacher, apply [here](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/pack_application) or for more information, see [Apply to GitHub Global Campus as a teacher](https://docs.github.com/education/explore-the-benefits-of-teaching-and-learning-with-github-education/github-global-campus-for-teachers/apply-to-github-global-campus-as-a-teacher).

## 🚀 Getting Started

TBD

## 🛠️ Customization

Customize your project for GitHub Codespaces by committing configuration files to your repository (often known as Configuration-as-Code), which creates a repeatable Codespaces configuration for all users of your project.

You can configure things like:

- Extensions, you can specify what extensions should be preinstalled.
- Dotfiles and settings.
- Operating system libraries and dependencies
